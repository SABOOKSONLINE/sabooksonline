				“Without a doubt, history is dictated by those who document it, thus for too long South African history has been scattered resulting in great difficulty to trace or retrace it. That was until SA Books Online, that is why we exist, to correct an unnoticed injustice to our land. As important as it is to document information, it is equally important that it is easily accessed.”
